## :fire: Object vs Functional Programming in JS :fire:
We will learn by pure examples how **Functional Programming** could give us a better approach than ~~Object Oriented~~- in some situations that we are currently dealing with.  



#### Javascript and FP
In Javascript we can use OOP as much FP paradigm, that's all that matter, so what is Functional Programming in a nutshell ?  

 - Inmutable data  
  > Immutable data **cannot be changed** once created, leading to much simpler application development and trace of the **state** of our program.  
 - Pure functions
  > A pure function is a function that, given the **same input**, will always return the **same output** and does not have any observable side effect.  

All this is possible because in Javascript functions are **First Class citizens** that means **functions are values**, so we can passed it around between functions.

### Now Let the fight begin:
- First round
- Second round
- Third round
